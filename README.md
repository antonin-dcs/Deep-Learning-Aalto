# Deep-Learning-Aalto
All my assignements and projects for the course 'Deep Learning' at Aalto University

Testing and training on different network architecture such as : 

VGG-19 network : Very deep convolutional network
ResNet : Deep network architechture that enable the computation of very deep archictecture by using skip connections
