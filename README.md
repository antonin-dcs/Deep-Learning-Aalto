# Deep-Learning-Aalto
All my assignements and projects for the course 'Deep Learning' at Aalto University (Helsinki)

The notebooks encompass : 

VGG-19 network : Very deep convolutional network ;
ResNet : Deep network architechture that enable the computation of very deep archictecture by using skip connections

Regularization techniques such as weight_decay, L2 reg, dropout, early stopping, data_injection
